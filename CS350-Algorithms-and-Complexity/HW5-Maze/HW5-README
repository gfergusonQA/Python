		○ Create Python Virtual Environment (first time only)
			■ Run in terminal (in specified Python folder): python3 -m venv .venv
			■ Run in terminal (in specified Python folder): source .venv/bin/activate
				● You’ll notice “(.venv)” as your folder location in your terminal
for the next command onward…
			■ Run in the same terminal (both commands at the same time is ok):
				● pip install --upgrade pip
				  pip install black flake8 isort pytest ipython
			■ Create first Python project by running this in terminal:
				● vim HW5-maze.py
			■ In the VIM editor, paste the HW5-Maze.py code text (or … )
			■ ESC to leave the Insert mode in VIM, and type “:wqa” to write, quit, all
			■ Run the program in the terminal:
				● Python HW5-maze.py

	○ Running the program:
		■ Source .venv/bin/activate in the Python folder
		■ Install NumPy in Python folder
			● Run in the terminal after starting .venv:
				○ Pip install numpy

VIM User, not new to using python via terminal:
	● In your Python folder, place my file HW5-maze-attempt-1.py inside.
	● Start the Python environment by running this in the terminal:
		○ Source .venv/bin/activate
	● Then run this in the terminal to run the program:
		○ Python HW5-maze-attempt-1.py
	● You should then see a user menu in the terminal that indicates the program has
started for you. Try testing the 3x3, 5x5 and 1000 maze count by selecting the
appropriate option in the user-driven menu.
